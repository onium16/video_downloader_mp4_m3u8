Video_downloader_mp4_m3u8  1.0
The script for download videos mp4 and m3u8.

    The script is based on the ffmpeg program. The script is designed 
    to download mp4 and m3u8, links containing these names.
    For the script to work, download and place in the working folder 
    ffmpeg-6.0-essentials_build, or another version of the program, 
    but in this case it is necessary to make changes to the program 
    settings by specifying the correct path to the program executable file.
